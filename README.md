### Testing

### Bugs Discovered

#### Solved Bugs

1. Navbar link alignment
  * The navbar links would automatically align on the left of the screen next to the logo. 
  * To solve this I applied justify-content: flex-end, allowing the links to hug the right side of the screen
  * Code from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_justify-content.asp)

2. Footer layout
  * The layout of the footer element would align vertically, even on larger screens.
  * To solve this I put each section (message and social links) into its own div. Then added width:40% and float:left to the message div and width:60% to the social lik div.

3. Footer social link layout
  * The layout of the footer social links aligned vertically,  wasting the provided space.
  * To solve this I added diplay:inline to the css, allowing them to align horizontally.
  * Code from [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5661520/centering-2-divs-inside-another-vertically)

4. Hero image unresponsive
  * The hero image aligned centrally but was unresponsive, so was partially hidden on smaller screens.
  * To solve this I added max-width: 100%, height auto. this allowed it to resize on smaller screens without stretching and compremising the image quality on larger screens. 
  * Code from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp)

5. Section dividers (hr) invisible
  * After entering section dividers, the space would be present but no line was visible.
  * To solve this I added a border-top: 2px solid yellow, which showed the dividing line while staying in the width perameters I had already set.
  * Code from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_style_hr)
#### Remaining Bugs

1. Carousel unresponsive
  * The carousel does not centralise or resize for smaller screens.

2. Video link Layout
  * The youtube videos leave a large space underneith before the footer. This is particularly evident on larger screens.
