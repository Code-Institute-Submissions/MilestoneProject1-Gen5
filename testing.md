### Bugs Discovered

#### Solved Bugs

1. Navbar link alignment
  * The navbar links would automatically align on the left of the screen next to the logo. 
  * To solve this I applied justify-content: flex-end, allowing the links to hug the right side of the screen
  * Code from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_justify-content.asp)

2. Footer layout
  * The layout of the footer element would align vertically, even on larger screens.
  * To solve this I put each section (message and social links) into its own div. Then added width:40% and float:left to the message div and width:60% to the social lik div.

3. Footer social link layout
  * The layout of the footer social links aligned vertically,  wasting the provided space.
  * To solve this I added diplay:inline to the css, allowing them to align horizontally.
  * Code from [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5661520/centering-2-divs-inside-another-vertically)

4. Hero image unresponsive
  * The hero image aligned centrally but was unresponsive, so was partially hidden on smaller screens.
  * To solve this I added max-width: 100%, height auto. this allowed it to resize on smaller screens without stretching and compremising the image quality on larger screens. 
  * Code from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp)

5. Section dividers (hr) invisible
  * After entering section dividers, the space would be present but no line was visible.
  * To solve this I added a border-top: 2px solid yellow, which showed the dividing line while staying in the width perameters I had already set.
  * Code from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_style_hr)

6.  Carousel unresponsive
  * The carousel does not centralise or resize for smaller screens.
  * To solve this I added width: 70%, margin-left: 0 auto, margin-right: 0 auto, allowing the carousel to be responsive and centralised.

7. Table columns are uneven
  * The table on the index page are uneven and dependent on the content added to them.
  * To solve this I replace the entire table with two replacements,each with a bootstrap template. One for larger screens and one for smaller screens.
  * Code from [bootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/), container-large
  * Code from [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16351404/bootstrap-combining-rows-rowspan), container-small

8. PS/Xbox hero image alignment
  * The hero images of the console pages are not aligned aesthetically.
  * To solve this I seperated the hero image and past images onto seperate levels and made each responsive to the full width of the page. 

#### Remaining Bugs

1. Video link Layout
  * The youtube videos leave a large space underneith before the footer. This is particularly evident on larger screens. 

2. Accordian cards not level
  * The cards in each accordian seem to be aligned by the bottom of the card, rather than the top.

3. Progress bar unresponsive
  * The progress bar does not repond to input from the questionnaire, requires javascript.
